This rule is easy to under- stand for a single share, but if we sell multiple shares of stock bought over a long period of time, then we must identify the shares actually being sold. A standard accounting principle for identifying which shares of a stock were sold in such a case is to use a FIFO protocol—the shares sold are the ones that have been held the longest (indeed, this is the default method built into several personal finance software packages). For example, suppose we buy $100$ shares at $\\$20$ each on day 1, $20$ shares at $\\$24$ on day 2, $200$ shares at $\\$36$ on day 3, and then sell $150$ shares on day 4 at $\\$30$ each. Then applying the FIFO protocol means that of the $150$ shares sold, $100$ were bought on day 1, $20$ were bought on day 2, and $30$ were bought on day 3. The capital gain in this case would therefore be $100·10 + 20·6 + 30·(−6)$, or $\\$940.$ \n","\n","Write a Python module that reuses/extends the array-based queue implementation. The program takes as input a sequence of transactions of the form “buy x share(s) at y each” or “sell x share(s) at   y each,” assuming that the transactions occur on consecutive days and the values x and y are integers. Given this input sequence, the output should be the total capital gain (or loss) for the entire sequence, using the FIFO protocol to identify shares.\n","\n","Your program should include all the necessary error checking.\n","\n","Link to the array-based FIFO implementation: \n","\n","https://drive.google.com/file/d/18aPwNh1TIoSWsDSKhof5Lm_Eg-if0tLP/view?usp=share_link\n","\n","Sample Program Usage:\n","\n","```\n","portfolio = StockPortfolio()\n","\n","portfolio.buy(100, 20)\n","print(portfolio.get_total_gain_loss()) # Output: 940\n","portfolio.buy(20, 24)\n","print(portfolio.get_total_gain_loss()) # Output: 940\n","portfolio.buy(200, 36)\n","portfolio.sell(150, 30)\n","print(portfolio.get_total_gain_loss()) # Output: 940\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"IxAKzxBcf5Dz"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Not enough stocks to sell\n","The total capital gain is: 1000\n"]}],"source":["# YOUR CODE HERE\n","#from ..exceptions import Empty\n","import re\n","\n","class ArrayQueue:\n","  \"\"\"FIFO queue implementation using a Python list as underlying storage.\"\"\"\n","  DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 10          # moderate capacity for all new queues\n","\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    \"\"\"Create an empty queue.\"\"\"\n","    self._data = [None] * ArrayQueue.DEFAULT_CAPACITY\n","    self._size = 0\n","    self._front = 0\n","\n","  def __len__(self):\n","    \"\"\"Return the number of elements in the queue.\"\"\"\n","    return self._size\n","\n","  def is_empty(self):\n","    \"\"\"Return True if the queue is empty.\"\"\"\n","    return self._size == 0\n","\n","  def first(self):\n","    \"\"\"Return (but do not remove) the element at the front of the queue.\n","\n","    Raise Empty exception if the queue is empty.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # if self.is_empty():\n","    #   raise Empty('Queue is empty')\n","    return self._data[self._front]\n","\n","  def dequeue(self):\n","    \"\"\"Remove and return the first element of the queue (i.e., FIFO).\n","\n","    Raise Empty exception if the queue is empty.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # if self.is_empty():\n","    #   raise Empty('Queue is empty')\n","    answer = self._data[self._front]\n","    self._data[self._front] = None         # help garbage collection\n","    self._front = (self._front + 1) % len(self._data)\n","    self._size -= 1\n","    return answer\n","\n","  def enqueue(self, e):\n","    \"\"\"Add an element to the back of queue.\"\"\"\n","    if self._size == len(self._data):\n","      self._resize(2 * len(self.data))     # double the array size\n","    avail = (self._front + self._size) % len(self._data)\n","    self._data[avail] = e\n","    self._size += 1\n","\n","  def _resize(self, cap):                  # we assume cap >= len(self)\n","    \"\"\"Resize to a new list of capacity >= len(self).\"\"\"\n","    old = self._data                       # keep track of existing list\n","    self._data = [None] * cap              # allocate list with new capacity\n","    walk = self._front\n","    for k in range(self._size):            # only consider existing elements\n","      self._data[k] = old[walk]            # intentionally shift indices\n","      walk = (1 + walk) % len(old)         # use old size as modulus\n","    self._front = 0                        # front has been realigned\n","\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","  fifo1 = ArrayQueue()\n","  fifo2 = ArrayQueue()\n","\n","  # input = [[0, 100, 20], [0, 20, 24], [0, 200, 36], [1, 150, 30]]     #0- buy, 1- sell\n","  # input1 = [[1, 1000, 20]]\n","  # for i in input:\n","  #   if i[0] == 0:\n","  #     fifo1.enqueue(i[1:])\n","  #   if i[0] == 1:\n","  #     fifo2.enqueue(i[1:])\n","\n","\n","  def Input(input):\n","    for i in input:\n","      if i[0:4] == \"buy \":\n","        nums = [int(nums) for nums in re.findall(r'-?\\d+\\.?\\d*', i)]      #For reference\n","        fifo1.enqueue(nums)\n","      elif i[0:4] == \"sell\":\n","        nums = [int(nums) for nums in re.findall(r'-?\\d+', i)]\n","        fifo2.enqueue(nums)\n","        \n","    CapitalGain()\n","\n","\n","  def CapitalGain():\n","    global answer\n","    answer = 0\n","    \n","    while not(fifo2.is_empty()):\n","      current1 = fifo1.first()\n","      current2 = fifo2.first()\n","      \n","      #Error Checkings\n","      if fifo1.is_empty():\n","        print(\"Not enough stocks to sell\")\n","        break\n","\n","      #Capital Gain Computation\n","      if current2[0] -
